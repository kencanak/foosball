## Foosball App

This application is keeping track of internal foosball game board :)

## Tech 
This application is built using MEAN stack. Scaffolding is generated by using Yeoman Angular-Fullstack
https://github.com/angular-fullstack/generator-angular-fullstack

Great scaffolding, credits to DaftMonk


## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all these prerequisites:
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/) and the npm package manager, if you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.
* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).
* Bower - You're going to use the [Bower Package Manager](http://bower.io/) to manage your front-end packages, in order to install it make sure you've installed Node.js and npm, then install bower globally using npm:
* Sass - run "gem install sass" to install
* Compass - run "gem install compass" to install
* Bootsrap-Sass - run "gem install bootstrap-sass" to install


```
$ npm install -g bower
```

* Grunt - You're going to use the [Grunt Task Runner](http://gruntjs.com/) to automate your development process, in order to install it make sure you've installed Node.js and npm, then install grunt globally using npm:

```
$ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```

### Cloning 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/kencanak/foosball.git
```

## Install
The first thing you should do is install the Node.js dependencies.

To install Node.js dependencies you're going to use npm again, in the application folder run this in the command-line:

```
$ npm install
```

To install all bower dependencies run this command-line:

```
$ bower install
```

## Running This Application
After the install process is over, you'll be able to run your application using Grunt:

```
$ grunt build
```

To launch it locally, run this in the command-line:

```
$ grunt serve
```

Your application should run on the 9000 port so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)
                            
That's it! your application should be running by now, to proceed with your development check the other sections in this documentation.

## Building  This Application
To build this application for production environment, run:

```
$ grunt build
```
Because grunt will read environment config to look for source files, ,make sure you run this command in development environment. After running this command, a minified and concat-ed version for your script will be create under public/dist make sure it link to the correct file in config/env/production.js.


### Heroku

Deploying to heroku only takes a few steps.

    yo angular-fullstack:heroku

To work with your new heroku app using the command line, you will need to run any `heroku` commands from the `dist` folder.


If you're using mongoDB you will need to add a database to your app:

    heroku addons:create mongolab

Your app should now be live. To view it run `heroku open`.

>
> If you're using any oAuth strategies, you must set environment variables for your selected oAuth. For example, if we're using **Facebook** oAuth we would do this :
>
>     heroku config:set FACEBOOK_ID=id
>     heroku config:set FACEBOOK_SECRET=secret
>
> You will also need to set `DOMAIN` environment variable:
>
>     heroku config:set DOMAIN=<your-heroku-app-name>.herokuapp.com
>
>     # or (if you're using it):
>
>     heroku config:set DOMAIN=<your-custom-domain>
>

To make your deployment process easier consider using [grunt-build-control](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/grunt-build-control).

#### Pushing Updates

    grunt

Commit and push the resulting build, located in your dist folder:

    grunt buildcontrol:heroku


## Bower Components

* angular
* angular-cookies
* angular-mocks
* angular-resource
* angular-sanitize
